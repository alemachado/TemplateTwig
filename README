Installation:
Copy TemplateTwig directory to site/modules
Download Twig from http://twig.sensiolabs.org/
Extract and copy Twig directory from lib to PageTwig directory (ie. PageTwig/Twig)

Ensure http daemon has write access to site/assets/cache dir (this should be the case anyway)
Copy views directory to site (this contains some sample Twig views)
Copy files from templates directory to site/templates (these are the controllers that call the Twig views)
Create pages that use the twig templates.

NOTE: As Twig handles html escaping etc itself, you can usually remove any htmlspecialchars filters from your fields.
If you don't do this you may run into double-escaping issues.
